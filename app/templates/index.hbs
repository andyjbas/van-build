        I fit everything together out of the van first and did a few test runs to ensure I had a good understanding of how it works before trying to install it in the van. The gist of it is that a diesel fired furnace heats coolant which is circulated through a coolant-water heat exchanger for hot water, and then an air exchanger for climate control via a thermostat, and then the coolant is returned to the furnace to start the process over again.
